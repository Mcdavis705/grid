# Introduction to Using Local Storage with React

In this project, we will learn how to use **Local Storage** in a React application. Local Storage is a browser feature that allows us to save data persistently on the user's device â€” even after the page is closed and reopened. This is useful for storing user settings, application states, preferences, and more.

## Project Overview

We will build a React app that features a **4x4 grid of items**. When an item is clicked, its color will change. The app will also include buttons to:

* **Save** the current state of the grid to Local Storage
* **Load** a previously saved grid state from Local Storage
* **Clear** the grid to its initial state

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Project Setup

* Create a new React project using **Vite**
* Install and configure **Tailwind CSS** for styling

  * Tailwind simplifies building user interfaces by using utility-first CSS classes

### 2. Grid Implementation

* Create a React component to render a **4x4 grid** (16 items)
* Use the `useState` hook to manage an array of 16 boolean values that represent the state of each item in the grid

### 3. Event Handling

* Implement click functionality for each item:

  * When an item is clicked, toggle its state
  * Update the state array accordingly using `useState`

### 4. Local Storage Integration

* Use `localStorage.setItem()` to save the current grid state when the **"Save"** button is clicked
* Use `localStorage.getItem()` to load a previously saved grid state when the **"Load"** button is clicked
* Provide a **"Clear"** button that resets the grid state (all values to `false`)

With this setup, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

* React state management
* Local Storage APIs
* Handling user interactions
* Utility-first CSS styling with Tailwind

This project is a great introduction to combining persistent storage with interactive UI in modern web development.
